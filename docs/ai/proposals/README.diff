EXPLANATION:

The root package.json uses npm workspaces:

```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    "backend",
    "extension"
  ]
}
```

With npm workspaces, running `npm install` at the repository root automatically
installs dependencies for all workspace packages (backend and extension).

The current instructions to `cd backend && npm install` and `cd extension && npm install`
are redundant and could confuse contributors.

RECOMMENDED CHANGE:

Replace step 4 from:
```bash
npm install
cd backend && npm install
cd ../extension && npm install
```

To:
```bash
npm install
```

This matches the pattern documented in CLAUDE.md which correctly states:
> Install all | `npm install` (root, workspaces auto-resolve)
